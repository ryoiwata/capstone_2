10:15~11:45 Worked on having an actual example in notebook. 
Based off of cheese and tomatoe as an agreeable example. 
Dealt with having too many molecules per ingredient node. 
So coded in the notebook to ignore nodes that were only connected to one ingredient. 

11:45~12:15 Reading up on name == main so that I can code better

12:15~2:00 lunch

2:15~2:45 Started a simple random walk algorithm
