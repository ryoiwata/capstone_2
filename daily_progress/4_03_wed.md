# Day 3, Wednesday (2019/03/03)

10:00 ~ 10:30: Created a small subset of the data
* Might need to make representative samples based on food categeory

10:30~11: Based on the small subset, made a dict of dict of dict with weighted values being the number of shared molecules. Then put that into a network X graph. Might make the dataset a little smalle because 100 is too much. 

11:~11:30
Tried downloading graph tool, but couldn't quite get it to work. Will take a break from it and try using docker in the afternoon

1:30~2:00 playing around with default dict so that a node can only be made when it has shared molecules with other ingredients

3 Lecture with Kristina

4:30~5 changed the format of the graph a little, so that molecules are nodes as well

5:30~6:30 Finished updating the format and now have a graph with nodes of molecules and ingredients
