# Ingredient Analysis in Recipes with Graph Theory

## Summary 

Through webscraped cooking recipes from Recipe Puppy API, I found ingredients pairs that can act as substitutes for each other in recipes that contain either ingredient. 

## What if graph theory?

Graphs are a way to represent relationships between subjects of interest. In this project, each subject or node is an ingredient. The relationship between each node or edge, would be the number of times the two ingredients share a recipe.
